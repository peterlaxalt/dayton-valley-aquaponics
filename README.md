## Run On Development

2. `git clone git@github.com:peterlaxalt/dayton-valley-aquaponics.git`
3. `cd dayton-valley-aquaponics`
4. `bundle install`
5. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
6. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) or [localhost:4000/](localhost:4000/)

## Fire up a .ngrok server
* You can access your ```localhost:4000``` from any device because ```.ngrok``` is amazing. In terminal, simply type ```$ ./ngrok http 4000``` to fire up a server and they will provide urls.

## Deploy via Terminal
* We're hosted up on Github pages, deploying off of the ```master``` branch.
* To deploy, simply ```git add .``` your changes, leave a commit message as ```git commit -m "always improving"``` and then deploy by ```git push origin master```.

## Edit content & settings via Forestry.io
* If you aren't too code savvy, we're also hooked up to Forestry.io. Log in to the CMS of the Dayton Valley Aquaponics site at ```/dva-admin/```. Any updates will be published after pressing ```publish```.
